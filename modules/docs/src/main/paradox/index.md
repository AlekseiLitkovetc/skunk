## Overview

- Skunk is a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) library for [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org).
- Skunk is powered by [cats](http://typelevel.org/cats/), [cats-effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/), [scodec](http://scodec.org), and [fs2](https://fs2.io).
- Skunk is purely functional, non-blocking, and provides a tagless-final API.
- Skunk programs compile quickly (faster than [doobie](https://tpolecat.github.io/doobie/) programs anyway).
- Skunk gives very good error messages.
- Skunk embraces the [Scala Code of Conduct](http://scala-lang.org/conduct.html).
- **Skunk is pre-release software!** Code and documentation are under active development!

Skunk is published for Scala $scala-versions$ and can be included in your project thus:

@@dependency[sbt,Maven,Gradle] {
  group="$org$"
  artifact="$core-dep$"
  version="$version$"
}

@@dependencies { projectId="core" }
